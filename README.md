# The Spack Buildbot Configuration

Welcome, this is the buildbot configuration and infrastructure used by the
Spack Buildbot at http://spack.io.  It's used to automate the process
of testing packages to Spack project. if you would like to
contribute to improving our testing infrastructure please open a pull request
against this Github repository. If you have any questions or feedback, feel
free to contact us at <FIXME@Spack.io>.

## Build and Test Strategy

### Builder Types

Nightly,Weekly and specific package groups are tested. This is queued up for testing on all 
of the available builders.  There is currently only one type of builder:

* BUILD: These builders are responsible for verifying that a change
  doesn't break the build on a given platform.  Every patch set 
  is built and reported on individually.  This helps guarantee that
  developers never accidentally break the build.

  To maximize coverage builders have been created for most major Linux
  distributions.  This allows us to catch distribution specific issues and to
  verify the build on a wide range of commonly deployed kernels.

  Additional builders are maintained to test alternate architectures.  If
  you're interested in setting up a builder for your distribution or
  architecture see the 'Adding a Builder' section below.

  No elevated permissions are required for this type of builder.  However,
  it is assumed that all required development tools and headers are already
  installed on the system.

### Build Steps and the `runurl` Utility

The Spack Buildbot makes extensive use of the `runurl`
utility.  This small script takes the URL of a script to execute as its first 
argument followed by all arguments to pass to the script. This allows us to
configure a build step which references a trusted URL with the desired script.
This means the logic for a particular build step can be separated from the
`master.cfg` which has some advantages:

* Minimizes the disruption caused by restarting the buildbot to make
  changes live.  This is only required when modifying the `master.cfg`.
  For example, when adding/removing a builder or adding a test suite.

* Build and tests scripts can be run independently making it easy for
  developers to locally test proposed changes before submitting them.

* Allows for per-builder customization via the environment.
  Each script can optionally source the following files to influence its
  behavior.

  * `/etc/buildslave` - This file is dynamically generated by the
    `bb-bootstrap.sh` script and is run at boot time by the ec2 user data
    facility.  It includes all the information required to configure and
    start a latent buildslave.  Most importantly for scripts this includes
    the `BB_NAME` variable which is set to the build slave name.

* Provides a consistent way to trap and handle signals from the buildbot
  master.  This is particularly helpful when attempting to collect debug
  information prior to terminating an instance.

## Configuring the Master

### Important Files

The Spack Buildbot configuration is broken out in a few different files.
Below is a list of important files and a brief description of what is
contained within them:

* `master/master.cfg` - Core configuration file for the Spack Buildbot.

* `master/password.py.sample` - Sample credentials file used to create
  a `master/password.py` file. This file contains build slave passwords,
  various user passwords, and EC2 credentials.

* `master/Spackbuildslave.py` - Contains custom BuilderConfig and
  EC2LatentBuildSlave classes used by the Spack Buildbot. If new types
  of build slaves need to be created, please define them in this file.

* `master/Spackfactory.py` - Contains core and supporting functions that 
  construct BuildFactories for Spack Buildbot builders. If new types of
  build factories need to be created, please define them in this file.

* `master/Spackgittagpoller.py` - Contains a subclass of buildbot's
  GitPoller class called SpackTagPoller. The class is designed to
  poll a git repository for changes in tags. If a new or modified tag
  is found, a change is then submitted to the build master. 

### Credentials

The `master/passwords.py` file contains the credentials required for the
buildbot to interact with ec2.  It stores static passwords for
non-ec2 build slaves, the web interface and `buildbot try`.  See the
`master/passwords.py.sample` file for a complete description.

### Adding a Builder

The process for adding a new builder varies slightly depending
if it's a standard or latent builder.  In all cases the
process begins by adding the new builder and slave to the `master.cfg` file.
One important thing to be aware of is that each builder can potentially have
multiple build slaves.

The first step is to determine what kind of slave you're setting up.  Both
standard and latent build slaves are supported.

Once you've added your slaves, be sure to add them to the `all_slaves` list 
at the bottom of the BUILDSLAVES section in `master.cfg`.  Classes have been
provided with suitable default values for slaves. Below are examples on
how to add various types of slaves.

* Linux based m3.large EC2 slave
```
newslaves = [                                                                                     
     SpackEC2Slave(
         name="slavename",
         ami="ami-xxxxxxxx"
     ),
     ....
]
```

* Suse based m3.large EC2 slave
```
newslaves = [                                                                                     
     SpackEC2SuseSlave(
         name="slavename",
         ami="ami-xxxxxxxx"
     ),
     ....
]
```

Now that your build slaves have been added, a builder needs to be created which
owns them.  Jump down to the the BUILDERS section and add a
`SpackBuilderConfig` entry to the appropriate list.  Each builder must
have a unique `name`. Set the `factory` to `build_factory` for the builder.
Then set `properties` and `tags` options as appropriate.

Finally, you must restart the build master to make it aware of your new
builder.  It's generally a good idea to run `buildbot checkconfig` to verify
your changes.  Then wait until the buildbot is idle before running
`buildbot restart` in order to avoid killing running builds.

### Updating an EC2 Build Slave to Use a Different AMI

New AMIs for the latest release of a distribution are frequently published for
ec2.  These updated AMIs can be used by replacing the current AMI identifier
used by the build slave with the new AMI identifier.  All build slaves are
listed in the BUILDSLAVES section of the `master.cfg` file.  Remember the
buildbot will need to be restarted to pick up the change.

### Running a Private Master

The official Spack Buildbot can be accessed by everyone at
http://Spack.io/. Developers are encouraged to use this infrastructure
when working on a change. However, this code can be used as a basis for
building a private build and test environment.  This may be useful when working
on extending the testing infrastructure itself. We recommend using https://github.com/opensfs/buildbot 
Building Buildbot via pip or some other package installer can cause compatibility issues.

Generally speaking to do this you will need to create a `password.py` file
with your credentials, then list your builders in the `master.cfg` file, and
finally start the builder master.  It's assumed you're already familiar with
Amazon ec2 instances and their terminology.
